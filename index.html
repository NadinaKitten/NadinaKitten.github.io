    <h1>Welcome to NadinaKitten's webpage!</h1>
    <body>
        <p>
            This is going to be a place for me to practice html.  Bear with me as this page is under construction.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will start with some paragraphs.  The goal is to try out as many formats as I can in one page.
        </p>
        <p><i>
            This paragraph is italicized, but there is no semantic reason too, so screen readers will read this the same as any other line.
        </i></p>
        <p><em>This</em><i> paragraph is also italicized, but I used semantic emphasis on the first word, so screen readers will have read it differently.  Still, putting an entire paragraph in italics can be confusing for the average reader.</i></p>
        <p>
            Okay, let's try something different.  I want to <em>emphasize</em> that this page is a work in progress.  I am following a learning path on LinkedIn Learning, from which I am learning about <strong>accessability</strong>.
            I believe accessibility can only be a good thing.  More people access your website, leads to more people potentially telling their network about you.  If you are <em>not</em> accessible, you could lose potential visits.
            Why do I mention this?  Because one of the reasons I am taking so long to develop my first apps is <strong>accessibility</strong>: I am taking the time to listen and research how best to make my apps <em>accessible</em> and customizable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the previous paragraph, I used 2 types of semantic markers - em and strong.  Screen readers will have placed emphasis on the correct words, and viewers are able to easily determine the semantic meaning within the paragraph.
            I challenge my audio-visual able visitors to use a screen reader on this page.  The next section, when I create it, will <em>look</em> identical to the paragraph above, but screen readers will tell you something completely different.
