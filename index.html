    <h1>Welcome to NadinaKitten's webpage!</h1>
        <p>Hi, my codename is NadinaKitten, and I am a new developer looking to practice and expand my skills.  I am working on expanding my knowledge of the following:</p>

            Luau - Roblox Studio
        </summary>
        <p>My First Adventure (tentatively named)</p>
        <p>A casual game spanning several places within one experience.  The game mechanics aren't fully decided on yet, as I am really using this experience to learn Luau and familiarize myself with game development software.  After realizing I wanted to share this experience with others and make it both enjoyable <em>and</em> secure, I decided to use <a href="https://madstudioroblox.github.io/ProfileService/">ProfileService</a>, developed by MadStudio.</p>
        <p>I have successfully created a quest module and tutorial quest line, and received help from the <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/">devforum</a> to make my code simpler.  I am currently reworking the places to include teleports between different areas.  The plan is to have a tutorial zone, where players can learn everything about every aspect of the game, and dedicated areas for specific skills such as farming, forestry, gathering, and mining.  Teleportation is working properly thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4DymnlVuL0">this video</a>, and has given me the confidence needed to break this large project into smaller, more managable pieces.</p>
        <p>Also on my list of development is implementing a level system for each of the life skill trees, with perks for leveling both the skills themselves, and the tools related(where tools are required to perform actions).  The most ambitious piece by far is the customization - I want to make my game accessible, which to me requires allowing players to change color settings for the overall GUI, as well as the NPC interactions.  I was inspired by <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/making-accessible-games-for-the-disability-aware-era-a-not-fully-comprehensive-guide-by-an-actual-disabled-developer/1375919">this post</a> and continue to keep it in mind while developing other apps outside of Roblox.</p>
        <p>This adventure is slated to be complete by the end of 2024.</p>

            Python
        </summary>
        <p>Data analysis, on the surface, might look boring to some, but to me it is exciting.  Even at work, with my limited access to reports, I am always excited by the possibliies of how you can retrieve large amounts of data quickly, and what knowledge you can glean by analyzing it.  Thus, my journey with Python began.</p>
        <p>Using the learning path on LinkedIn Learning, I followed a series of courses which introduced me to Python, and culminated in created a Quiz App.  This ran entirely in the terminal, and while it worked, it wasn't exactly a work of art, or very accessible.  Currently, I am using Tkinter to design a GUI for the app, and have successfully created the main page, allowing the user to enter their name before proceeding to the main menu.</p>
        <p>This project is taking me a lot of time to complete, mainly because my understanding of the limitations of Tkinter was incomplete.  I have tested it, and determined that the way I had originally wanted things to look would not be possible, and had to change my approach drastically.  Also, aside from actually taking quizzes, I am implementing ways to allow the user to customize their experience, from changing the colors and fonts to allowing the option to display a timer while taking quizzes or keeping it hidden.</p>
        <p>Completion of the QuizApp is set for December 2023.  After the quiz app is complete, my next challenge is to create a Solitaire game.</p>

        <p>This web page is also part of my learning experience.  I endeavor to add as much meaningful HTML as I can, while also creating a beautiful webpage.</p>

            SQL
        </summary>
        <p>I have started another learning path on LinkedIn Learning, to give me a broad unserstanding of SQL, before diving in and learning enough to be able to use it proficiently.</p>

            Unity(to be changed)
        </summary>
        <p>Unity is used to make a lot of the games that I enjoy, and I was curious as to how it worked.  I am working through the tutorials, and plan to develop a game that my children enjoy offline, with no ads.  If they find it enjoyable enough, I will make it available to the public with a subscription.  Possible completion date set for 2026.</p>
       <p>*edit* Due to the recent decisions made by Unity, I will no longer be pursuing this game engine.  I am exploring other options, and will update this page once I have decided to commit to another engine.</p>
        </details>
       <p>As a new and unproven developer, I am aware that the road ahead is long and not easy.  However, working on several projects outside of my normal, unrelated work has fulfilled me in a way my full-time job has not.  All of my learning in this past year has led me to realize one very important thing: I enjoy working with technology, and making the experience for the users easier.  At the time of this writing, I am pursuing education on IT and it's related structures, with the goal of attaining a job in the IT Support field.  I have been pleasantly surprised by how much I already know, thanks to having a custom built PC that doesn't always cooperate, and aging infrastructure at my place of work that constantly needs attention.</p>
       <p>Thanks for taking the time to visit me!  Check back later for more updates as I continue my learning journey.</p>
